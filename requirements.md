> Important

* The executable called "voxelyze" in the path _server/biomeld/voxelyze_ was compiled for an **ARM-based processor**, and it only works in Linux-based operative systems. If your server has an x86-based or amd64-based processor and it has a different operative system, you need to compile your own executable using the code contained in the following repository:
  
  https://github.com/skriegman/reconfigurable_organisms.
  
* Don't forget to consider the two modifications to the source code of the physics engine mentioned in the README file!

* Lines 18-22 of the "Main.py" file, provide a suggestion regarding the server deployment.
